# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

After going through and reading the instructions for an exercise, I'll systematically go through and write notes and 
make an outline of the decision structure/s needed.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

Ensuring I'm not relying on the weekend or the second half of the week to finish the work. Hope for the best, plan for the worst.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

Applying the programming patterns provided and rechecking for solution the subject teaches us to use.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I should spend more time getting comfortable with different methods and operations in the terminal.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

Maybe, in addition to the lecture videos, and the lecture slides, a more indepth summary of each section, 
EG1012 provides document style pdf lecture summaries, having a more in-depth lecture summary that I can re-reference 
if I'm stuck or don't want to search through a 30 minute video for a single point.

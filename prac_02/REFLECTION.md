# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

About 50%, if it's a coding exercise I am struggling to start, I'll watch the video.

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

After reviewing the pdf's and completing the practicals, but before reviewing and submitting the practical and completing the quiz.
During the school week, at the university or at home.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

Reviewing the practical feedback and searching for the correct way to do something and the justification for it, rather than receiving it in the feedback.
Avoiding making changes to the code to prevent warnings, so I don't get marked down (differences between IT and Eng).

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

Review the way Pycharm operates its functions and avoid using habits formed from using MATLAB in a different IDE.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

Trying to independently engineer a solution for coding problems, rather than just copy+pasting directly from the style guide.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

Attempting the practicals early in the week, so I can spend more time reviewing and revising, or doing extension work.

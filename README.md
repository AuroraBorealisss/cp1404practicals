# CP1404 Practicals
## Prac_07 README exercise
This repo is part of the assessment within the CP1404 - Programming 2, a subject at James Cook University. 
CP1404 is a subject I'm undertaking as part of my Bachelor of Engineering.
This is a public repo used to ensure students are well versed in version control, code reviews, and other important practical skills they'll use in their profession.
## 3 important lessons about clean code:
- Don't repeat yourself
- store values as what they actually are, e.g. store a date *as a date*
- Single responsibility principle for functions
